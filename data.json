         "methodology":"Peer counselors are used less frequently in hospital settings, perhaps because establishing and maintaining such programs goes beyond traditional medical practice and raises concerns around cost and liability. Boston Medical Center (BMC) is an inner-city teaching hospital with approximately 2000 births per year",
         "result":"Our ongoing study indicates  peer counselors increase breastfeeding duration among mothers of infants admitted to the NICU. Mothers of premature infants between 26 and 37 weeks gestational age are randomly assigned to intervention or control groups, where women in the control group receive a standard-of-care treatment while women in the intervention group receive standard-of-care treatment and peer counselor support.",
         "discussion":"Despite some issues with reliability, peers add unique insights, abilities, and cultural diversity to the postpartum unit. They can manage time-consuming issues such as social support while the LC is freed up to deal with potentially high-risk or medically complex issues.",

         "abstract":"A national program to promote breast-feeding was launched in 1978 following the publication of a position paper by the Canadian Paediatric Society. The second phase of the program was addressed to new mothers and consisted of a brochure which underlined the benefits of breast-feeding and contained practical information to assist mothers in starting breast-feeding successfully.",
         "introduction":"The mid 1970s saw an unprecedented rise in interest in promoting breast-feeding. At the national level in Canada, this first became evident with a strongly supportive position paper by the Canadian Paediatric Society issued in 1978.",
         "methodology":"A mail questionnaire was designed in conjunction with Statistics Canada. The following questions were asked: Did you read the booklet? Did you learn something new about breast-feeding? If you did learn something would you specify what it was? Did you find the practical suggestions useful? Had you seen the booklet before receiving it in Gift-Pax? Was/ is your baby breast-fed? The questions were prepared in both French and English and printed on a small pre-paid postage card addressed to the Department of National Health and Welfare. The card was inserted into the booklet by Gift-Pax Canada during the routine assembly of the gift pack",
         "result":"A summary of the responses to the questions is shown in table i. As expected the response to the question (did you read it?) was virtually 100%. A rather unexpected finding was the high positive response to the question (did you learn anything new?) with almost 41% indicating they had learnt something new.",
         "discussion":"While recognizing the limitations of the survey (a small response rate) the results have provided some insight into the concerns that this sample of 500 mothers had about breast-feeding. The booklet appeared to be well received by these mothers and contained information that was useful to them.",

Breastfeeding increased with the initiation of education and the involvement of obstetric personnel and did not significantly decrease when the lactation coordinator became half-time. The transition to model 3 resulted in decreased costs without significantly affecting the incidence of breastfeeding. Breastfeeding was significantly associated with counseling by obstetric personnel, with prenatal care at JMC, and with breastfeeding education sessions.",

Workload and work stress sometimes become obstacles that cause irregular breastfeeding, rush and even boring and unpleasant activities. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of using audiovisual media on the duration of breastfeeding for working mothers.",
         "introduction":"The failure of exclusive breastfeeding for six months is often experienced by working mothers. The most common reason for the failure of exclusive breastfeeding in working mothers is insufficient breast milk production in more than 90% of cases, and 10% is due to infant disease and maternal disease. The causes of the lack of breast milk production in working mothers are because of the stress experienced by working mothers. Working mothers have higher stress levels than mothers who do not work. stress can inhibit the production and secretion of lactating hormones. Disruption of production and secretion of lactation hormone will cause the least production of breast milk which ultimately affects the length of breastfeeding. The increase in oxytocin is triggered by the sound of crying and laughing babies, nipple suction during the breastfeeding.",
         "methodology":"The study population was working mothers who had returned to work after maternity leave  and obtained permission from their leaders to breastfeed at work. During working hours, the mother was separated from her baby. The audiovisual media used video recordings of baby activities stored on the personal cellphone of each working mother.

Oxytocin is a hormone that is conditioned on the mother\u2019s feelings, such as touching, kissing or seeing her baby, or hearing the cry of her baby, or thinking about it with affection.

         "introduction":"malawi has high rates of neonatal and infant mortality and morbidity1. since 1990, the country has made progress towards achieving the target of millennium development goal (mdg) four, reducing under-five mortality by two- thirds, and of mdg five, reducing maternal mortality by half by 2015, but like other countries in sub-saharan africa, the progress has been insufficient2.",
         "methodology":"counseling visits from january 2005, the volunteer counselors began to identify pregnant women in their communities and make a home visit at five key points during pregnancy and after birth. in each visit the counselors discussed and supported women on a range of exclusive breastfeeding and other important neonatal and infant care practices.",
         "result":"the intervention has been introduced in a large rural population in the district and has been running since january 2005. it is hypothesised that through the intervention women learn new infant feeding and care behaviours by modeling the behaviour and by learning from the experiences of volunteer counselors experienced in breastfeeding and infant care.",
         "discussion":"the intervention described in this paper seeks to increase rates of exclusive breastfeeding and reduce infant mortality in mchinji district, malawi, through volunteer delivered infant feeding and care counseling. the impact of the groups on mortality and behaviour will be published in 2012.",

         "introduction":"exclusive breastfeeding upto 6 months is cur- rently recommended in developed as well as in developing countries as the optimal feeding mode for all infants. the advantages of breast feeding observed in developed countries in-clude:reduction of mortality rate and prevention of some bacterial illnesses such as otitis media, lower respiratory tract infection, bacter-aemia and meningitis; reduction of certain immunological disorders as well as of certain chronic diseases; promotion of mother-infant interaction and bonding; and a substantial eco-nomic impact. despite the above mentioned recommendation and advantages, in italy recent studies found that although 62%84% of women started exclusive breast feeding, only 19%23% continued to 6 months.",
         "methodology":"the study was conducted from 15 september 1993 to 15 june 1994 in the well baby outpatient clinic of the paediatric institute of the Catholic University of Rome. The well baby outpatient clinic serves a heterogeneous population that lives in the city of Rome and in neighbouring towns. A 10-minute counselling session on breastfeeding was provided to all women during the paediatric visit. a stratified randomised design was used.",
         "result":"two hundred women were recruited, 103 were allocated to the treatment group and 97 to the control group; no women were lost to follow up.The median duration of exclusive breast feeding for those receiving the booklet was24 weeks (interquartile range 1331) compared with22 weeks for those not receiving the booklet (interquartile range 1329). The median duration of complementary breast feeding for those receiving the booklet was 27 weeks (interquartile range 1735) compared with25 weeks(interquartile range 1730) for those not receiving the booklet.",
         "discussion":"it is welcome to see a randomised controlled trial, that holy grail of epidemiologists, applied to health promotion even with negative results. The authors imply that breastfeeding has limited support in italy (no mothers roomed-in in hospital, paediatricians were alone in promoting breast feeding). It is therefore hardly surprising that a booklet alone does not make a difference. The provision of a booklet is based on the premise that mothers need more information about breast feeding. Improving the duration of breast feeding is a highly desirable objective. It is remarkable that both groups of mothers breast fed for so long: 48.5% were exclusively breast feeding at 6 months in the treated group and 43.7% in the non-treated. This compares with 30% at 12 weeks in Newcastle upon Tyne. the authors state that the participants were a selected group and this may be the explanation. There is no mention of socioeconomic status, which is a key variable, and i wonder if most of the mothers were from a higher income group.",

         "introduction":"Ankyloglossia (commonly known as tongue-tie) is a congenital anomaly characterised by an abnormally short, tight or thick lingual frenum attached near the tip of the tongue. It restricts tongue tip mobility and can cause poor breastfeeding and maternal nipple pain. It is present in 4% to 11% of newborns 1. Frenotomy is commonly performed in Canada, Australia, and USA to solve tongue-tie related breastfeeding difficulties.",
         "methodology":"Since 2016, the lactation clinic of the department of obstetrics and gynaecology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital has taken a more active role to help babies with tongue-tie and breastfeeding difficulties. If feeding problems persisted, the babies were referred to a paediatric hospital for treatment. When indicated, frenotomy was suggested and performed upon consents using bipolar diathermy forceps under no anaesthesia.",
         "result":"From July 2016 to June 2018, 49 babies with tongue-tie and persistent breastfeeding problems were referred for consultation for frenotomy. In the frenotomy group, the most common breastfeeding difficulties was poor attachment (61.11%), followed by sore nipples (30.56%), ineffective suckling (5.56%), and poor weight gain (2.78%). After frenotomy, sore nipple was the most improved symptom with a mean rating of 8.18 (n=11), followed by poor attachment with a mean rating of 6.91 (n=22).",
         "discussion":"Ultrasonographic studies on breastfeeding revealed that a flexible, extendable tongue is important in efficient removal of breastmilk. The need for frenotomy for infants experiencing breastfeeding difficulties has been highlighted. In addition, the breastfeeding rate (direct or bottle) at 4 months was 91.67% in the frenotomy group and 77.78% in the non-frenotomy group, which is higher than the Hong Kong average of 55.7%.",

         "introduction":"Breastfeeding is natural (physiological) and instinctive and nearly all mothers do it, so one may ask what is there to learn and teach about breastfeeding? After a woman gives birth, the establishment of a mature milk supply is dependent upon the presence of mammary tissue, regular removal of milk from the breast, and a set of maternal hormones, prolactin and oxytocin.",

         "abstract":"Background: New Zealand (NZ) has a high rate of breastfeeding initiation, declining sharply during the first six months. Although there is a range of support available to breastfeeding mothers, access can be problematic in rural areas. To extend the accessibility of breastfeeding support to rural women, a primary health organisation established a breastfeeding peer supporters (BPS) programme (Mum4Mum M4M). Objectives: The objective of this study was to gain an understanding of the impact of the BPS training programme on participants, as well as understanding how they utilised the information, both personally and in their communities.",
         "introduction":"Exclusive breastfeeding until babies are 6 months of age is considered optimal for both child and maternal health. However, New Zealand (NZ) and international studies show that the rate of breastfeeding declines sharply during the first 6 months. In NZ in 2013, ~17% of infants were exclusively breastfed at 6 months, with lower rates for Maori and Pacific infants and babies living in areas of high deprivation. The decision to cease breastfeeding is influenced by a range of issues from having sore nipples to cultural influences.",
         "methodology":"In March 2014, all women who had completed the Mum4Mum training between 2007 and early 2014, and for whom current contact details were available (65%, 100/153), were contacted via a variety of channels including email, Facebook, breastfeeding support groups and text, and invited to complete an online survey. The free-text comments were analysed using a general inductive thematic approach.",
         "result":"Forty-one out of 100 BPS graduates completed the survey. Five key themes emerged from the qualitative analysis: knowledge gained and shared; increased confidence; role of peer support; acceptance; personal satisfaction.",
         "discussion":"This is the first study to explore the views of peer supporters in providing breastfeeding support in rural New Zealand through the Mum4Mum initiative. The findings of this study correspond with other studies of breastfeeding peer supporters, suggesting they are valid. This evaluation, set in the real world of a rural primary health organisation, demonstrates how the Mum4Mum training initiative by the West Coast Primary Health Organisation resulted in the establishment of a network of breastfeeding peer supporters across the region, a strategy recognised as effective in the support of initiation and maintenance of breastfeeding.",

         "abstract":"The Malaysian Breastfeeding Peer Counsellors (MBFPC) is the pioneer of non -governmental organization (NGO) of trained breastfeeding peer counsellors in Malaysia initiated in 2010. In 2015, MBFPC partnered with Global Health Media Project (GHMP) to incorporate breastfeeding videos as training tool to further enhance the delivery of current breastfeeding peer counsellor trainings to the participants, emphasizing on helping breastfeeding mothers. The new training tool was evaluated in 38 participants, who underwent 21 hours of training. All participants felt that the videos made the training more effective and helped change their understanding and approach.",
         "introduction":"Mother -to-mother support has been identified as one of the factors contributing to the success rate of prolonged breastfeeding, or at least exclusive breastfeeding in the first 6 months of life. A 2007 Cochrane review of breastfeeding promotion programs indicated that lay support (trained non - professionals) who may or may not share the same socioeconomic and cultural background is effective in increasing breastfeeding duration and that the benefits increase to exclusive breastfeeding more than to any breastfeeding.",
         "methodology":"In the recent training which started in 2015, the GHMP videos were introduced during sessions along with the current training materials and methods as a new visual tool to better illustrate certain topics related to the modules covered. A pilot study where 38 participants were recruited to undergo a 21 -hour training over 3 days. A total of 4 trainers with International Board Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC) credentials conducted the training sessions. Following the training sessions, participants were required to go through a 2 -month practical period of observing and helping at least 4 breastfeeding mothers.",
         "result":"All of the participants reported bringing their smartphones with them for the visits. The mothers they visited had various breastfeeding -related issues. 33 showed the videos to the mothers and 23 of them showed more than one video. Breastfeeding attachment and breastfeeding positioning were the most frequently shown videos and reportedly the most useful by the participants.",
         "discussion":"The overall quality of the video is suitable for training purposes. All participants and trainers agreed that the videos were easy to be used and understood. Having the videos as part of the training tools help the trainers to deliver the content of the modules in a more efficient way. Less demonstrations were need and it was easy to capture participants attention on the topic discussed. The videos concluded each topic well especially with the element of take home messages points at the end of each video. The videos will also be most suitable to be incorporated in other breastfeeding training especially involving health care personnel as they may have more opportunity to practice most of the topics covered in the video series.",

NNS may improve the efficacy of oral feeding, reduce the length of time spent in orogastric (OG) tube feeding, and shorten the length of hospital stays for preterm infants. This study aimed to assess the effect of pacifiers on preterm infants in the transition from gavage to oral feeding, their time to discharge, weight gain, and time for transition to full breastfeeding. A prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted in our center. Ninety infants were randomly divided into two groups: a pacifier group (PG) and a control group. In this study, we determined that the method of giving pacifiers to preterm infants during gavage feeding reduced the infants\u2019 transition period to oral feeding and the duration of hospital stay.",
         "introduction":"Feeding challenge is one of the most frequently encountered problems in preterm infants. One of the main causes for a prolonged length of stay in the hospital for preterm infants is the failure to complete effective breastfeeding.",
         "methodology":"This prospective, single-center, randomized, controlled study was conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of the University of Health Sciences Zekai Tahir Burak Maternity Teaching Hospital between July 2016 and November 2017. The infants were divided into two groups as follows: control group, including 45 infants not using pacifiers and pacifier group (PG), including 45 infants using pacifiers.",
         "result":"The time for transition to full oral feeding, time to transition to full breastfeeding, and time to discharge in the PG were significantly shorter compared with the control group. For preterm infants with gastrointestinal motility disturbance, similar symptoms in the PG were significantly lower than the control group.",
         "discussion":"Pacifier use significantly decreased the time of transition from gavage feeding to oral feeding and duration of hospital stay. Pacifiers are not recommended for term infants because of the relationship between pacifier use and decreased incidence of exclusive breastfeeding. However, preterm infants have immature neurological development and uncoordinated sucking-swallowing-breathing pattern which means they cannot be fed by mouth successfully and safely, so, improving sucking skills and pacifier use recommendations need to be based on a benefit-risk approach focus for preterm infants. In addition to the WHO recommendation, which is generally accepted around the world, it is necessary for units to act according to their specific problems and the characteristics of their populations.",

Methods: An operational team was formulated to identify the reasons for low proportion of exclusive breast feeding (EBF) in healthy neonates. Reason specific solutions were proposed, discussed, prioritized and tested using plan-do-study-act cycle (PDSA cycle). Strategies included clear departmental policy plan and creation of breastfeeding support package (BFSP). PDSA cycles were tested and implemented over 6 weeks period and its sustainability was measured monthly for five months duration. Results: After implementation of PDSA cycles, the proportion of neonates receiving early breastfeeding within one hour of birth increased from 55% to 95%, and the proportion of neonates on EBF during hospital stay increased from 72% to 98%. Conclusion: Quality improvement principles are feasible and effective to improve breastfeeding practices in the hospital setting.",
         "introduction":"Breastmilk is safe, available, affordable and one of the most effective ways to ensure child health in developing countries.",
         "methodology":"Mother-newborn pairs who were healthy and delivered vaginally were included. Newborns delivered by lower segment caesarean section, critically sick neonates, preterm neonates not on breastfeeding/expressed breastmilk, neonates of retro-positive mothers who declined breastfeeding, and neonates having major congenital malformations requiring surgical intervention were excluded (fig. 1). A team consisting of faculty members from departments of pediatrics, obstetrics and community medicine; health educator; a nutritional counselor; the sister in-charge of the labor room, and a staff nurse from postnatal ward was constituted to evaluate the reasons for non-exclusive breastfeeding (NEBF) and to plan the strategy for the promotion of optional breastfeeding practices. A baseline survey was conducted by the nutritional counselor for three days/week from 10:00 to 12:00 hr and 14:00 to 16:00 hr every day in December 2016, to know the prevailing breastfeeding practices.",

         "discussion":"Low- and middle-income countries lose more than $70 billion annually due to low rates of breastfeeding. Universalization of breastfeeding in India may reduce 1,56,000 under-5 deaths, 39,00,000 episodes of diarrhea, 34,36,560 episodes of pneumonia and 7,000 deaths due to breast cancer annually. Our root cause analysis showed widespread use of NEBF to be due to poor antenatal care, and lack of information on optimal infant feeding, especially EBF, given by health workers at health institutions. The present study suggests that QI principles are feasible and lead to improved rates of BFP during hospital stay.",

         "introduction":"Objective: describe the level of compliance with the dispositions of law 155 in government agencies.",
         "methodology":"A cross sectional descriptive study was carried out. A sample of 28 government agencies was randomly selected, representing 25% of the total number of agencies, and a structured telephone interview was administered using an instrument made up of 6 premises.",
         "result":"All (100%) of the agencies had knowledge about the existence of this law, but only 50% had set up and equipped the spaces. Of these, all had a table, a chair, and an electric outlet, 43% had available running water, and 71% provided a refrigerator for milk storage. Fifty three percent of the agencies reported having received followup communications to verify whether they were complying with the law, and 61% reported having a written public policy in support of breastfeeding for working mothers. Only 54% of the agencies stated they had offered some type of orientation to their women employees regarding their breastfeeding rights.",
         "discussion":"In spite of over two years since the passing of law 155, the majority of government agencies in Puerto Rico have not complied with its legal dispositions. It is necessary that the responsible entities watch for the satisfactory compliance with this law since working mothers need a secure and accessible place for milk extraction during the working day.",

This is known to be partly due to the mothers deficient knowledge of proper breastfeeding. To find out whether training of nursing mothers for breastfeeding can enhance their lactation, we also tried to compare the effects of metoclopramide on lactation with those of training.",
         "introduction":"Unsuccessful breastfeeding after discharging a mother and her newborn infant from the hospital may be caused by many factors, including maternal ignorance about importance of breastfeeding, the shortage of the mothers information concerning the proper practice of breastfeeding.",
         "methodology":"Throughout 2006, we consecutively enrolled 20 primipara nursing mothers who were referred to Tabriz Childrens Hospital, Tabriz, Iran for counseling about prescription of infant formula as a response to their complaint of insufficient lactation. We weighed the newborns and all mothers passed a short training course about perfect practice of breastfeeding; then we randomly allocated them in two equal groups of 10 mothers.",

Of these, 58 initiated breastfeeding, 50 were breastfeeding on discharge, and the median duration was 28 days. The diaries and questionnaires revealed several themes including peer support, pride, disruption, breastfeeding benefits, and the role of the breastfeeding guardian.",
         "discussion":"The findings were encouraging, with all teenagers offering positive views about the benefits of breastfeeding and the role of the guardian. Success was dependent on a number of factors, including their ability to cope with and adapt to disruptions in their daily living, self-pride, a belief that they were doing the best for their baby, and crucially, the support, praise, and recognition received from peers.",

When discussing risk related to a common behavior (such as smoking in the 1950s and 1960s), it can be an enormous challenge to change the prevailing attitudes and beliefs about the behavior. The benefits-based message of breastfeeding has been interpreted to mean that breastfed infants are \"healthier\" than \"normal\" infants, akin to an athlete being more fit than an average healthy person. By this reasoning, formula-feeding is accepted by the public as \"normal,\" and breastfeeding is an \"ideal\" that may be achieved only by a select few.",

This article highlights government initiatives such as the Breast Buddy campaign which are specifically designed to encourage these young women to breastfeed.",
         "introduction":"Breastfeeding is one of the most accessible and effective health interventions in the world, with extensive benefits for mothers and babies alike. The Department of Health (DH) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of an infant's life, with continued breastfeeding alongside solid foods after that, and would like to see more women breastfeeding for longer.",
         "methodology":"The Infant Feeding Survey (2005) data was used and the Breast Buddy Campaign was launched and assessed.",
         "result":"Nine out of ten mothers would have liked to breastfeed their babies for longer, but for the 16\u201325-year-old age group, for whom breastfeeding is not the norm and who do not have access to role models among family and friends, it is vital to give them easily accessible, approachable support.",
         "discussion":"The campaign is underpinned by texting, a method of communication that is familiar and trusted by young people. The new mother-to-be texts BUDDY to 60022 to join the scheme and in doing so she receives a free information pack containing a letter from Jenny Frost, information about breastfeeding for the mother and the buddy and encouraging breastfeeding.",

         "introduction":"Indonesia is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. The psychological stress experienced by mothers during a disaster has a high risk of reducing breast milk production. Thus, breastfeeding mothers in disaster-prone areas need more disaster preparedness support, such as the breastfeeding education program. The purpose of this research was to identify the effects of the breastfeeding education program (BEP), apron, and disaster evacuation baby carrier (DEBC) on the breastfeeding self-efficacy of mothers in disaster-affected areas.",
         "methodology":"This research employed a pre-posttest quasi-experimental design, involving mothers in disaster-prone areas in southeast Minahasa regency, North Sulawesi, Indonesia. Mothers were selected using cluster randomized controlled trial and divided into two groups: intervention and control group.",

         "discussion":"This research suggests that the BSES mean scores differed significantly across the intervention and control groups. The results of this research have shown that implementation of BEP with apron and baby carrier were effective in increasing the self-efficacy of breastfeeding mothers. It is therefore expected that, during disasters, mothers are likely to breastfeed successfully. Mothers equipped with the apron and DEBC also show increased self-confidence.",

         "methodology":"Of 1545 mothers who delivered in the maternity department of a district general hospital over a period of 18 months, 1525 (98.7%) were interviewed as soon as possible after delivery. Mothers who attempted to breast-feed at least once were defined as breast-feeders. All breast-feeders (678) were entered into a randomised controlled trial to measure the effectiveness of a lactation nurse on the establishment and duration of breast-feeding.",
         "result":"The duration of breast-feeding among mothers in the experimental group was significantly extended by the lactation nurse, that is, she enabled a higher proportion of mothers to establish successfully and furthermore to continue for as long as they thought necessary or desirable.",
         "discussion":"It was not expected that the lactation nurse would influence the time at which mothers first put the baby to the breast as she did not ever work in the delivery area. However, it was expected that she would increase the frequency of feeds, encourage mothers to demand feed, and discourage supplementary bottle-feeds.",

The program provided sound knowledge and attitudes toward breast feeding to all mothers at the antenatal care unit, delivery room, the postnatal care unit, and the outpatient department. The program activities included early bonding, assistance with initiation of breast feeding, rooming-in, provision of a breast feeding comer in the special care unit, collecting breast milk for sick babies, a lactation clinic and home visits. The impact of the program was evaluated in 1992. Altogether 1,428 mothers were interviewed using structured questionnaires. The results were highly encouraging.",
         "introduction":"Breast milk is the most adequate and nutritious milk for feeding infants, but studies from Thailand have shown that breast feeding practice has continuously declined for both urban and rural residents (Tontisirin et ai, 1983). Among those who delivered at a university hospital, only 17.4 percent breastfed their babies at the six weeks postpartum visit (Pongthai et ai, 1981). In its fourth national and social development plan (1977-1981), the government included the promotion of breast feeding as a priority. The Ministry of Public Health is responsible for the promotion country wide. Maharat Nakhon Ratchasima Hospital is the largest regional hospital of the Ministry.",
         "methodology":"The integrated comprehensive breast feeding promotion program was developed during May to October 1987. The objectives of the program were to promote breast feeding and/or prevent further decline of the practice. Physicians and nurses from four departments (Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Social Medicine, and Nursing) held a seminar and training about the program... The outcome of the program was evaluated between 1st January and 15th March 1992. 1,428 mothers, 98 percent of whom delivered babies at the hospital, were interviewed using structured questionnaires.",
         "result":"The program had been operating well with full participation from all hospital staff concerned. However, due to a busy delivery room, early bonding was possible only in approximately 60 percent of the mothers. Very few mothers could give exclusive breast feeding, mainly because of the local tradition of early feeding of the baby with mashed banana and cooked rice.",
         "discussion":"The study was conducted four years after the implementation of the program, when breast feeding practices at birth in Maharat Nakhon Ratchasima Hospital were as high as 90 percent. However, provision of longer maternity leave and of nurseries at the work place might sustain the duration of breast feeding. Milk insufficiency is one of the most common reasons for mothers failing to initiate breast feeding and interrupting it prematurely.",

Data based on 2,000 infants born in 1987 and 1990 showed a significant improvement on separation time of infant and mother after delivery and predominant breastfeeding, where the infant's predominant source of nourishment has been breastmilk. Separation time was reduced from 6.3 3.2 to 1.62 0.42 hours and predominant breastfeeding was significantly increased from 85 to 99 percent. Data obtained from the community related to the initiation and predominant breastfeedings showed a significant increase (p<0.05). No significant difference was demonstrated, however, on current breast feeding among infants who were delivery before and after initiation of the rooming-in system. Also analyzed were data on prevalence of deserted children. The findings showed a progressive reduction of deserted children after management of rooming-in. The study concludes that the practices of obstetricians were a key to successful breastfeeding.

         "introduction":"The failure of exclusive breastfeeding for six months is often experienced by working mothers. The most common reason for the failure of exclusive breastfeeding in working mothers is insufficient breast milk production in more than 90% of cases, and 10% is due to infant disease and maternal disease. The causes of the lack of breast milk production in working mothers are because of the stress experienced by working mothers. Working mothers have higher stress levels than mothers who do not work. stress can inhibit the production and secretion of lactating hormones. Disruption of production and secretion of lactation hormone will cause the least production of breast milk which ultimately affects the length of breastfeeding. The increase in oxytocin is triggered by the sound of crying and laughing babies, nipple suction during the breastfeeding.",
         "methodology":"The study population was working mothers who had returned to work after maternity leave  and obtained permission from their leaders to breastfeed at work. During working hours, the mother was separated from her baby. The audiovisual media used video recordings of baby activities stored on the personal cellphone of each working mother.

Oxytocin is a hormone that is conditioned on the mother\u2019s feelings, such as touching, kissing or seeing her baby, or hearing the cry of her baby, or thinking about it with affection.

         "abstract":"the aim of this report is to describe a health education intervention involving volunteer infant feeding and care counselors being implemented in mchinji district, malawi. the intervention was established in january 2004 and involves 72 volunteer infant feeding and care counselors, supervised by 24 government health surveillance assistants, covering 355 villages in mchinji district. it aims to change the knowledge, attitudes and behaviour of women to promote exclusive breastfeeding and other infant care practices.",
         "introduction":"malawi has high rates of neonatal and infant mortality and morbidity1. since 1990, the country has made progress towards achieving the target of millennium development goal (mdg) four, reducing under-five mortality by two- thirds, and of mdg five, reducing maternal mortality by half by 2015, but like other countries in sub-saharan africa, the progress has been insufficient2.",
         "methodology":"counseling visits from january 2005, the volunteer counselors began to identify pregnant women in their communities and make a home visit at five key points during pregnancy and after birth. in each visit the counselors discussed and supported women on a range of exclusive breastfeeding and other important neonatal and infant care practices.",
         "result":"the intervention has been introduced in a large rural population in the district and has been running since january 2005. it is hypothesised that through the intervention women learn new infant feeding and care behaviours by modeling the behaviour and by learning from the experiences of volunteer counselors experienced in breastfeeding and infant care.",
         "discussion":"the intervention described in this paper seeks to increase rates of exclusive breastfeeding and reduce infant mortality in mchinji district, malawi, through volunteer delivered infant feeding and care counseling. the impact of the groups on mortality and behaviour will be published in 2012.",

         "introduction":"exclusive breastfeeding upto 6 months is cur- rently recommended in developed as well as in developing countries as the optimal feeding mode for all infants. the advantages of breast feeding observed in developed countries in-clude:reduction of mortality rate and prevention of some bacterial illnesses such as otitis media, lower respiratory tract infection, bacter-aemia and meningitis; reduction of certain immunological disorders as well as of certain chronic diseases; promotion of mother-infant interaction and bonding; and a substantial eco-nomic impact. despite the above mentioned recommendation and advantages, in italy recent studies found that although 62%84% of women started exclusive breast feeding, only 19%23% continued to 6 months.",
         "methodology":"the study was conducted from 15 september 1993 to 15 june 1994 in the well baby outpatient clinic of the paediatric institute of the Catholic University of Rome. The well baby outpatient clinic serves a heterogeneous population that lives in the city of Rome and in neighbouring towns. A 10-minute counselling session on breastfeeding was provided to all women during the paediatric visit. a stratified randomised design was used.",
         "result":"two hundred women were recruited, 103 were allocated to the treatment group and 97 to the control group; no women were lost to follow up.The median duration of exclusive breast feeding for those receiving the booklet was24 weeks (interquartile range 1331) compared with22 weeks for those not receiving the booklet (interquartile range 1329). The median duration of complementary breast feeding for those receiving the booklet was 27 weeks (interquartile range 1735) compared with25 weeks(interquartile range 1730) for those not receiving the booklet.",
         "discussion":"it is welcome to see a randomised controlled trial, that holy grail of epidemiologists, applied to health promotion even with negative results. The authors imply that breastfeeding has limited support in italy (no mothers roomed-in in hospital, paediatricians were alone in promoting breast feeding). It is therefore hardly surprising that a booklet alone does not make a difference. The provision of a booklet is based on the premise that mothers need more information about breast feeding. Improving the duration of breast feeding is a highly desirable objective. It is remarkable that both groups of mothers breast fed for so long: 48.5% were exclusively breast feeding at 6 months in the treated group and 43.7% in the non-treated. This compares with 30% at 12 weeks in Newcastle upon Tyne. the authors state that the participants were a selected group and this may be the explanation. There is no mention of socioeconomic status, which is a key variable, and i wonder if most of the mothers were from a higher income group.",

         "introduction":"Edgar Rey and Hector Martinez developed kangaroo mother care (kmc) in Columbia as a substitute for incubators in the care of the low birth weight infants. 1 Kangaroo mother care is defined as early, prolonged and continuous skin-to-skin contact between the mother and the low birth weight infant both in hospital and after discharge, with exclusive breastfeeding and proper follow up. 1 In this method the diaper clad infant is placed upright between the mothers' breasts.",
         "methodology":"Babies whose birth weight was less than 1500 grams were included in the study once they were stable. The effect of kangaroo mother care on breast feeding rates, weight gain and length of hospitalization of very low birth weight neonates was studied through a randomized control trial in 28 neonates. The kangaroo group (n=14) was subjected to kangaroo mother care of at least 4 hours per day in not more than 3 sittings. The babies received kangaroo care after shifting out from NICU and at home. The control group (n=14) received only standard care (incubator or open care system).",
         "result":"The results of the clinical trial reveal that the neonates in the KMC group demonstrated better weight gain after the first week of life (15.9 + 4.5 gm/day vs. 10.6 + 4.5 gm/day in the KMC group and control group respectively p<0.05) and earlier hospital discharge (27.2 + 7 vs. 34.6 + 7 days in KMC and control group respectively, p<0.05).

         "discussion":"Through a randomized control, the effect of KMC on weight gain and duration of hospitalization was studied in a total of 28 VLBW neonates - 14 in the KMC group and 14 in the control group. The neonates in the KMC group demonstrated better weight gain after the first week of life (15.9 _+ 4.5 gin/day vs. 10.6 _+ 4.5 gm/day in the KMC group and control group respectively p<0.05) and these babies were discharged 7.4 days earlier than the babies in the control group. Significantly greater mean daily weight gain shorter mean duration of hospital stay were achieved with kangaroo care method. The significance of early discharge underlies the fact that it decreases the infant'.s chances of contracting hospital-acquired infections and also decreases the economic burden imposed on the family.",

In an attempt to prolong breastfeeding duration in this population, the authors designed a new class to be taught by certified WIC (Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children) personnel to pregnant Spanish-speaking participants. The class was designed after a literature review and onsite ethnographic research. The term la cuarentena del bebe was introduced to signify the recommended 40 days when mothers should exclusively breastfeed, avoiding bottles, pacifiers, and supplementation.",
         "introduction":"Even as research continues to show additional benefits of breastfeeding, breastfeeding rates continue to decline in many pockets of the world. In Utah, the lowest breastfeeding duration rates are among the US Latino population.",
         "methodology":"The new curriculum focuses on the risk of early supplementation, using a new concept that we named la cuarentena del bebe. This term is based on Latinos use of the word cuarentena, referring to the 40 days after birth when nothing should enter the baby mouth except the mother breast.",
         "result":"The new class curriculum, with its accompanying feeding plan, has been pilot tested in Spanish by a registered dietitian (and the clinic director) among pregnant Spanish-speaking clients at the Rose Park WIC clinic in Salt Lake City.

A health education programme \"A Friend of Pregnant Women\" has been developed to provide information and skills in breast-feeding. The programme involved follow-up visits at the 3rd and 42nd day after delivery and at 4 and 6 months after delivery in a sample of 106 women.",
         "introduction":"Recent studies have shown that breast milk has many advantages over artificial milk (National Health and Medical Research Council, 1980; Baghurst, 1988). Breast milk is the best food for babies aged >6 months. The protein it contains, especially immuno-albin and ferric albin, can improve infant health and prevent gastrointest-inal and respiratory disease. Breast-feeding can also increase bonding between mother and child and is less expensive than bottle feeding. Com-munity health will, therefore, be improved, if a high proportion of women breast-feed their babies. In China, the rate of breast-feeding in urban areas has decreased in recent years.",
         "methodology":"Women were recruited from Huihai neighbour-hood, Luwan district. Pregnant women whose expected date of delivery was from December 1990 to June 1991 were recruited to the treat-ment group. The control group consisted of women from the same neighbourhood whose date of delivery was from May 1989 to December 1989. There were 130 women who registered with Luwan district Maternal and Child Health Centre during the period of recruitment to the treatment group.",
         "result":"A total of 44% of women answered the pre-test correctly. After the class, there was a significant increase in knowledge with 60% answering correctly. The rate of breast-feeding in the treatment group was 44% (46 women) 4 months after birth. This was significantly greater than that of the control group rate of 21%. Artificial feeding was practiced by 32.7% of the women in the treatment group and mixed feeding accounted for 24.8% (26 women) of the group.",
         "discussion":"Health education appears to be an effective strategy for increasing breast-feeding rates. Through health education, the mothers understanding of breast-feeding was increased. In addition, a significantly higher proportion of women who received the programme continued to breast-feed at 4 months. It is a pity that about one-third of mothers did not receive the health education programme. Pregnant women who lived outside of the area did not participate in the \"A Friend of Pregnant Women\" programme because of inconvenience and transport difficul-ties.",

A Sure Start Local Programme funded a Bangladeshi support worker to work with childbearing Bangladeshi women in the area; many of who are not fluent in English. A short evaluation of this work was conducted to assess the impact of bilingual breastfeeding support to women's uptake and duration of breastfeeding. The majority of women found the support worker to be the most helpful breastfeeding advisor and felt she influenced them to breastfeed. Despite this, a minority of women exclusively breastfed and most reported having problems feeding during hospital stay. This evaluation highlighted the need for further work in this area.",

         "introduction":"Breastfeeding is a practice that needs to be learned and is conditioned by women's attitudes, beliefs and cultural traditions.

A central exposure variable was the measurement of breast-feeding advice given to mothers through their WIC participation during pregnancy. The statistical methods used in this analysis take into account the selectivity bias problem that arises in comparing individuals who receive WIC benefits and those who do not.",

However, the multivariate analysis determines whether WIC participation during pregnancy leads to reduced breast-feeding or whether other factors that differ between participants and nonparticipants, such as income, may also explain the lower levels of breast-feeding observed for participants.",

It is necessary to transform their role from delivery attendance to an agent of change to deliver health messages. One of the important health messages will be on early initiation of breastfeeding (EIBF). The aims of this study is to determine the impact of TBA-friendly training model on TBAs' knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) to enhance their role as agent of change in the EIBF practice.",
         "introduction":"In Indonesia, only three quarter (73%) of deliveries assisted by health provider. Data from the 2010 Basic Health Survey showed that 43.2% mothers gave birth at home, and among them around 40.2% were assisted by TBA. One of the reasons behind the high proportion of delivery assisted by TBA in Indonesia is because of the number of village midwife is still very lacking. In Indonesia, the ratio of midwife to population is 27.3 per 100,000 populations, whereas the ideal ratio is 100 midwives per 100,000 populations.",
         "methodology":"This research was conducted using both quantitative (quasi-experimental design) and qualitative approaches (\"Rapid Assessment Procedure\" (RAP)). The research was conducted in Ciampea and Ciseeng sub-districts in Bogor district of West Java, during from February to August 2010. The population is all TBAs in Bogor district and sample needed for the intervention and control area was 53 TBAs each.",
         "result":"Demographic characteristics of the TBAs were not statistically different between the intervention and control groups. Overall, TBAs in both groups were old and low educated. The highest education among the TBAs was elementary school and do not have other job other than becoming TBA. Effect of intervention to TBAs' knowledge about EIBF at the beginning of intervention did not show any difference in knowledge score between intervention and control groups.",
         "discussion":"This study shows significant difference on knowledge about EIBF between TBAs who attended \"TBA-friendly training\" and those who did not. This is consistent with the meta-analysis conducted by Sibleywhich concluded that training for TBAs was significantly associated with improvement on knowledge, attitude, and practice of trained TBAs, as well as advice provided by the trained TBAs to mothers, compared to non-trained TBAs.5 Similar result was found by Okubagzhiin a study aimed to determine the impact of TBA training to improvement of maternal and child health indicators in Ethiopia.3 Improvement in maternal and child health indicators was apparent after training was conducted to TBAs, which resulted in behavior changes among the trained TBas in assisting delivery and providing infant and maternal care.",

The data obtained wa s analyzed into frequency and percentages. The result showed that 12.3% of the mothers initiated breast - feeding within 30 min of delivery, 93.2% of them fed colostrum, 9.6% of the respondents perceived tha t colostrum should n ot be fed to infants and 31.5% exclusively breast-fed their babies for 6 months. The major factors that militated against exclusive breast-feeding were that it caused firm breast to fall (6.4%) and tie s mother down (1 9.2%).

The benefits of breast-feeding to infant s and mothers are well documented (Dewey et al., 2000 ; Mayer Davis et al., 2008; Newcomb and Dietz, 2000) . WHO (2001) and UNICEF (2006) reported that breast - feedi ng provides infants with superior nutritional conten t that is capable of improving infant immunity an d possible reduction in future health care spending.",

We initiated measures in our inner-city hospital such as starting a dedicated lactation service, counseling the mothers prenatally and postnatally, educating hospital staff, and advocating with our state's Medicaid insurance to provide free home breast pumps. These measures were associated with improvement in our breast milk feeding rates in very low birth weight infants from 22% to 88% over 5 years. This article describes our multipronged approach and can help encourage and guide other units with similar demographics to improve their breast milk feeding rates.",
         "introduction":"Breast milk has advantages over formula and, with appropriate fortification, is considered the best possible nutritional option for preterm infants. It has been shown to reduce neonatal morbidities associated with prematurity such as late-onset sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, and hence reduced overall health care costs. Despite the advantages and evidence supporting the use of breast milk in preterm infants, the rates of breast milk utilization are lower in preterm infants compared to full-term infants.",

Our unit did not have a dedicated lactation service to counsel and support the mothers. In March 2007, we hired 1 International Board Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC) full time equivalent (FTE) and developed policies and procedures for breast milk feeding initiation, use, collection, and storage. We also made several other interventions including hiring additional IBCLC FTEs, starting an antenatal breastfeeding class, providing electric breast pumps for home use and so on.",

The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the proportion of preterm neonates receiving mother's own milk by day 7 of life after such an initiative.",
         "introduction":"The importance of exclusive breast milk is unquestionable for any neonate. Exclusively breastfed preterm neonates have better short-term (reduced rates of necrotizing enterocolitis) and long-term outcomes and obtain maximum immunological benefits [1e3]. The human milk feeding through neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) has been adopted into clinical best practices. Although the rates of \"any \"human milk use in nicu have improved during the last decade, efforts to help mothers in expressing and maintaining mother's own milk (mom) through discharge remains a concern [ 4].",

The institutional ethics committee approved the study protocol, and an informed consent was obtained from the mother of the neonates. The qi initiative was conducted at a level 3 nicu from may 10, 2018, to august 10, 2018. Inborn preterm neonates <34 weeks with a minimum hospital stay of 7 days were included in the study.",

The median age of the first ebm improved from 2.5 days to 1.16 days, and the amount of ebm on the first day improved from 0.24 ml to 2.6 ml ( p.002). The proportion of babies receiving ebm on the first day improved from 24% to 80% ( p.0001), and at the end of 7 days, it increased to 73% from 46% (p.02). The factors time to reach full enteral feeds, time to regain birth weight, rate of necrotizing enterocolitis, rate of sepsis, and proportion of babies on exclusive mother's milk during discharge appear comparable in both the groups.",

This qi initiative was based on previously published qi projects on early milk expression in preterm mothers, how special care bundles and structured approach affects mom use, and benefits of exclusive mom in preterm and very-low-birth-weight babies [ 5e11].

         "methodology":"Lactating mothers residing in sangam vihar, new delhi. 30 lactating mothers from 10 days to 3 months of postpartum residing in sangam vihar and who met the inclusion criteria. Convenient sampling was used to select the subjects and then randomization was done using lottery method to allocate the subjects to experimental and control group.",
         "result":"Findings related to pre and post lactational levels as evident by test weight scores of babies in both the groups were computed. Findings related to as to which galactagogue showed more increase, findings revealed that both fenugreek and fennel were equally effective in increasing lactation.",
         "discussion":"The present study revealed that most of the mothers irrespective of their parity had faced lactational problems and many of them were reluctant to reveal it. This in turn directly or indirectly influenced the health of the little one. Administration of natural galactagogues such as fenugreek and fennel which aids in increasing lactation of mothers are beneficial for them.",

Methods: A quality improvement initiative was undertaken at maternity-newborn care unit of a tertiary-care hospital. A team involving neonatologists/pediatricians, obstetricians, anaesthesiologists, and nurses in concerned areas identifiedproblem areas using fish bone analysis. Situational analysis wasdone through process flow mapping. Three plan-do-study-actcyles were undertaken. Firstly, sensitization of personnel wasdone and a written policy was made. Secondly, maternal counselling and procedural modifications were done. Lastly , efforts were made to improve duration of contact. Results: Rate of early skin-to-skin contact after plan-do-study- act cycle 1, 2 and 3, respectively was 87.5%, 90% and 83.3%. It was 100% after sustainability phase after four months. Conclusion: Early skin-to-skin contact was achievable through sensitization of all persons involved and simple procedural changes. Prolonging duration of contact remained a challenge. Keywords : breastfeeding, baby-friendly hospital, PDSA cycle.",
         "introduction":"Immediate to early skin-to-skin contact (SSC) of the newborn baby with mother is recommended in all deliveries, including caesarean sections [1,2]. SSC culminates to early initiation of breastfeeding (EIBF) by one hour after birth and leads to successful initiation of lactation [3,4]. EIBF reduces neonatal and infant mortality rate by achieving higher rates of sustained exclusive breast feeding [3,5]. EIBF in India is low at 41.6% of all live births [6]. No national data is available on SSC and EIBF rates in caesarean sections where it is definitely not a standard of care. Caesarean sections are also associated with lower exclusive breast feeding rates at six months as compared to vaginal births (VD), but these rates are similar to vaginal delivery if EIBF is achieved [7]. Therefore, the present quality initiative was undertaken to improve rate of SSC at birth among babies born by caesarean sections at our hospital.",
         "methodology":"This quality improvement (QI) initiative was undertaken by maternity-newborn units of from May 5 to June 30, 2017. Approval was taken from Institutional Ethics Committee. There are four operation theatres (OT) and one labour room (LR) at the facility located at five distant places. The unit sees about 120 deliveries per month, of which approximately 30% are caesarean sections. Sequential Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles were undertaken as per Point of Care Quality Improvement (POCQI) approach [8]. Inclusion criteria were: For mother: Any mother who was alert and responsive; For newborn: Term and late preterm (>34 wk/>1.8 kg estimated weight) with good breathing/crying and tone at birth. Early preterms and babies with gross congenital anomalies were excluded. The intervention used was initiating SSC at birth among caesarean section births (immediately or within 5 min) by placing baby on mother's chest (any duration).",
         "result":"During the study period, 64 babies were born through caesarean section, of which 60 were eligible to receive SSC and 52 babies actually received. Number of babies receiving SSC at birth rose from nil to 87.5% (14/16) over 15 days following consultation meeting (PDSA 1, Web Table I). It improved to 90% (18/20) after maternal counselling and re-planning procedures around OT table (PDSA 2). After assigning lactation nurse for monitoring mother-baby during SSC (PDSA 3), the number of babies receiving SSC remained high but the intervention had limited impact on duration of SSC. At the end of intervention phase, 83.3% (20/24) of eligible babies were receiving SSC which increased to 100% (34/34) after sustainability phase, till October 31st, 2017.",
         "discussion":"Present study showed that SSC in caesarean section was achievable by making a written policy, sensitizing doctors/nurses, sharing knowledge and evidence and involvement of mothers. Simple procedural changes around OT table were instrumental in bringing about a paradigm shift. A major limitation was not being able to achieve recommended duration of contact of one hour. We reported any duration of SSC as acceptable contact because it was a novel initiative which would give a head start to our future endeavours. Solutions for prolonging SSC could be allowing a birth companion (doula) or husband/partner/relative inside OT for prolonged stay with mother. A few similar studies from around the world were found on this topic; [10,12] most were undertaken in similar premise with similar interventions but most were on a larger scale, involving big teams.",

Objectives: This study was conducted to investigate breastfeeding education and support services provided to fm and ob residents in the United States. The results were compared with a 2011 study of peds residents. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a web-based survey emailed to Program Directors (PDs) of fm and ob residency programs in the United States. Results: Eighteen percent of PDs (95 of 515) completed the survey. Of these, 88% answered questions regarding education and support services provided. A median of 23 hours of breastfeeding education is provided to ob residents (4-year program) and 8 hours provided to fm residents (3-year program). In comparison, peds programs reported a median of 9 hours. The most commonly used settings included lectures with faculty and lactation consultants, similar to the peds study.

Although there is a range of support available to breastfeeding mothers, access can be problematic in rural areas. To extend the accessibility of breastfeeding support to rural women, a primary health organisation established a breastfeeding peer supporters (BPS) programme (Mum4Mum M4M). Objectives: The objective of this study was to gain an understanding of the impact of the BPS training programme on participants, as well as understanding how they utilised the information, both personally and in their communities.",
         "introduction":"Exclusive breastfeeding until babies are 6 months of age is considered optimal for both child and maternal health. However, New Zealand (NZ) and international studies show that the rate of breastfeeding declines sharply during the first 6 months. In NZ in 2013, ~17% of infants were exclusively breastfed at 6 months, with lower rates for Maori and Pacific infants and babies living in areas of high deprivation. The decision to cease breastfeeding is influenced by a range of issues from having sore nipples to cultural influences.",

In 2015, MBFPC partnered with Global Health Media Project (GHMP) to incorporate breastfeeding videos as training tool to further enhance the delivery of current breastfeeding peer counsellor trainings to the participants, emphasizing on helping breastfeeding mothers. The new training tool was evaluated in 38 participants, who underwent 21 hours of training. All participants felt that the videos made the training more effective and helped change their understanding and approach.",
         "introduction":"Mother -to-mother support has been identified as one of the factors contributing to the success rate of prolonged breastfeeding, or at least exclusive breastfeeding in the first 6 months of life. A 2007 Cochrane review of breastfeeding promotion programs indicated that lay support (trained non - professionals) who may or may not share the same socioeconomic and cultural background is effective in increasing breastfeeding duration and that the benefits increase to exclusive breastfeeding more than to any breastfeeding.",

Having the videos as part of the training tools help the trainers to deliver the content of the modules in a more efficient way. Less demonstrations were need and it was easy to capture participants attention on the topic discussed. The videos concluded each topic well especially with the element of take home messages points at the end of each video. The videos will also be most suitable to be incorporated in other breastfeeding training especially involving health care personnel as they may have more opportunity to practice most of the topics covered in the video series.",

Cognitive behavioral therapy derived techniques may be more useful in improving breastfeeding outcomes. We did this study to test the effectiveness of a single session of cognitive counseling compared to routine counseling in the third trimester for improving latch score. Fifty mother baby dyads were enrolled. Twenty-six mothers underwent cognitive counseling and 24 mothers underwent routine counseling. After birth, the latch scores were assessed within the first 24 hours in the newborn.",
         "introduction":"Out of 26 million babies born in India every year, only about 45% are breastfed within the first hour of life and 65% of children are exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months. Lack of confidence in mothers' ability to breastfeed, problems with the infant latching or suckling, breast pain, perceptions of insufficient milk supply, and a lack of individualized encouragement from their clinicians are some of the reasons can be overcome if the mother is informed antenatally about the benefits of breastfeeding.",
         "methodology":"All mothers in the study had a single session of antenatal counseling in the third trimester of pregnancy. A latch score of less than or equal to 7 was considered as a poor score.  Fifty-two mothers who were in the third trimester were enrolled in the study. Mothers whose antenatal scans showed presence of congenital anomalies were excluded. By simple randomization using sealed envelopes, 26 mothers underwent cognitive counseling and 24 mothers underwent routine counseling.",
         "result":"Out of 26 mothers who underwent cognitive counseling, only one mother had a latch score of less than 7. Among the routine counseling group of 24 mothers, 7 of them had a latch score of less than 7. The value was 0.015. This difference was statistically significant.",
         "discussion":"Most mothers discontinue breastfeeding because of lack of confidence to breastfeed, perception of insufficient milk, improper technique resulting in sore nipples, breast engorgement, and mastitis leading to pain. These problems can be solved if the women are counseled antenatally about breastfeeding. Cognitive behavioral therapy is commonly used to treat anxiety and depression. During cognitive behavioral therapy, current thoughts are analyzed, and the negative concepts are then attempted to be replaced by positive ones with an aim to change the behavior. Compared to routine counseling, a single session of cognitive counseling in the third trimester is effective in significantly improving the latch scores in the immediate newborn period. This is achieved by a simple intervention using limited resources. An improved latch score implies that the mother will have a more successful rate of exclusive breastfeeding for a prolonged period which in turn will help the community to have healthier babies and reduced mortality. We are grateful to Dr. Sahil, Dr. Samidha, and Dr. Priyanka for helping in data collection. Ms. Rochelle was the lactational counselor who helped in our counseling sessions.",

Place and Duration of Study: The study was conducted in the department of obstetrics of Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Islamabad, from November to December 2009. Methodology: Eligible mothers were assessed for the successful breastfeeding by using IBFAT tool. The time to initiate the first feed, time to effective breastfeeding, maternal satisfaction with the care provided, preference for the same care in future, and level of exclusive breastfeeding at the age of one month were also noted.",
         "introduction":"Breastfeeding is the healthiest and most natural way of infant feeding and successful lactation mainly depends on early initiation of breastfeeding. Unfortunately, breastfeeding rates in Pakistan are the lowest among South Asian countries. According to Pakistan demographic and health survey 2006-07, only 29% mothers initiate breastfeeding within 1 hour after delivery while exclusive breastfeeding rate up to 2 months of infant's age is only 55% and up to 6 months is just 37%. This dismal state of affairs is largely due to the practices of separating the mother and infant at the time of birth.",
         "methodology":"A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted from 1st November to 31st December 2009 in the obstetrics department of Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS), Islamabad, after approval of institutional ethics committee. Three research assistants, all physicians, were especially trained in assessing breastfeeding by using the 'Infant breastfeeding assessment tool' (IBFAT).",
         "result":"A total of 183 mother-infant pairs (92 in skin-to-skin care [SSC] group and 91 in conventional care [CC] group) were analyzed for breastfeeding behavior of the infants. The first breastfeed was 26.25% more successful in SSC group (58.8% in SSC group as compared to 32.5% in CC group with P-value of 0.001).",
         "discussion":"Infants should be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life to achieve optimal growth and development. Early mother-infant skin-to-skin contact is well known to increase the rate of exclusive breastfeeding. A recent Cochrane systemic review showed significant positive effects of early and longer skin-to-skin contact on exclusive breastfeeding.",

NNS may improve the efficacy of oral feeding, reduce the length of time spent in orogastric (OG) tube feeding, and shorten the length of hospital stays for preterm infants. This study aimed to assess the effect of pacifiers on preterm infants in the transition from gavage to oral feeding, their time to discharge, weight gain, and time for transition to full breastfeeding. A prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted in our center. Ninety infants were randomly divided into two groups: a pacifier group (PG) and a control group. In this study, we determined that the method of giving pacifiers to preterm infants during gavage feeding reduced the infants\u2019 transition period to oral feeding and the duration of hospital stay.",
         "introduction":"Feeding challenge is one of the most frequently encountered problems in preterm infants. One of the main causes for a prolonged length of stay in the hospital for preterm infants is the failure to complete effective breastfeeding.",

         "result":"The time for transition to full oral feeding, time to transition to full breastfeeding, and time to discharge in the PG were significantly shorter compared with the control group. For preterm infants with gastrointestinal motility disturbance, similar symptoms in the PG were significantly lower than the control group.",
         "discussion":"Pacifier use significantly decreased the time of transition from gavage feeding to oral feeding and duration of hospital stay. Pacifiers are not recommended for term infants because of the relationship between pacifier use and decreased incidence of exclusive breastfeeding. However, preterm infants have immature neurological development and uncoordinated sucking-swallowing-breathing pattern which means they cannot be fed by mouth successfully and safely, so, improving sucking skills and pacifier use recommendations need to be based on a benefit-risk approach focus for preterm infants. In addition to the WHO recommendation, which is generally accepted around the world, it is necessary for units to act according to their specific problems and the characteristics of their populations.",

With their highly visible role in the community, frequent interactions with soon-to-be and new parents, and knowledge of medication safety, pharmacists can be a key component in the promotion and support of breastfeeding, an important, and underutilized health behavior. This expanded role in breastfeeding support would be consistent with the pharmaceutical care concept. Exposing student pharmacists to breastfeeding information beyond traditional medication and lactation information can facilitate the early shaping of their attitudes and understanding.",

Online antenatal breastfeeding education is feasible; however, further research is warranted to determine if it can affect breastfeeding outcomes.",
         "introduction":"Increasing the number of infants who are breastfed has become a global health priority because of health and economic benefits of breastfeeding for mothers and their children. Two modifiable factors that predict breastfeeding rates are women's breastfeeding self- efficacy and breastfeeding intention. Antenatal education interventions can impact women's breastfeeding self- efficacy and intention; however, childbearing women may not attend traditional classes, because they use the internet for health information.",
         "methodology":"Twelve computer-based breastfeeding education modules were developed using an online learning platform. Changes in participants' breastfeeding self-efficacy and intention pre- and post-intervention were measured using descriptive statistics and a one-way ANOVA. The Healthy Moms intervention was designed to educate women about breastfeeding using 3D GameLab\u00ae, an online game-based learning platform. Women completed three quests orienting them to 3D GameLab\u00ae and up to 12 breastfeeding quests developed around three themes: deciding about breastfeeding, feeding your baby, and getting support.",
         "result":"Of the 25 women submitting the pretest, 4 completed zero quests; 7, orientation only; 8, one to six breastfeeding quests; and six, 10 to 12 breastfeeding quests.

Although the information about breastfeeding was reliable, it may not have seemed relevant to some participants at their current stage of pregnancy. Extending the intervention study time line through 6 weeks postpartum, using more accessible mobile technologies such as cell phone applications or social media platform, revising the way the information is delivered, adding opportunities for interaction, and partnering with providers could facilitate intervention engagement.",

Data from 80 preterm babies (40 pre-intervention and 40 post-intervention) admitted into the NICU between July 2009 and October 2012 were collected for the study. Data were collected from the MNNR, as well as the individual medical records of included babies. The primary outcome was growth at day 7, 14, 21, and at discharge and secondary outcomes were time to full oral feeding, breastfeeding rates, and adverse events.",
         "result":"Enteral feeding was started significantly earlier in the post-intervention group than in the pre-intervention group.

There was a trend in decrease in neonatal mortality rate but was not statistically significant. The important causes for neonatal mortality in India are prematurity, sepsis, and birth asphyxia. The nutritional and immunological benefits of pdHM would have contributed to the improved survival of these vulnerable neonates. Similarly, a decreasing trend of incidence of NEC was noted among VLBW and preterm neonates.

Newborns delivered by lower segment caesarean section, critically sick neonates, preterm neonates not on breastfeeding/expressed breastmilk, neonates of retro-positive mothers who declined breastfeeding, and neonates having major congenital malformations requiring surgical intervention were excluded (fig. 1). A team consisting of faculty members from departments of pediatrics, obstetrics and community medicine; health educator; a nutritional counselor; the sister in-charge of the labor room, and a staff nurse from postnatal ward was constituted to evaluate the reasons for non-exclusive breastfeeding (NEBF) and to plan the strategy for the promotion of optional breastfeeding practices.
